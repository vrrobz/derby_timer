# Arduino-Powered Pinewood Derby Timer

## Introduction
This is the code and notes repository for a Pinewood Derby timer I am building based on the Arduino Pro Mini board. 

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

This timer is intended to replace our pack's existing, outdated timer system. We are part of Pack 317 in Concord, CA and were quoted in excess of $500 for a new timer setup. I think I can build a better one for less than $100 (not including labor, which I'm, of course, donating). 

The features for this should include:
  * Independent timing on four tracks
  * Actual times in ms recorded and maintained for the last five races
  * Interface with our existing timer output and sensors
  * WiFi access point through ESP8266 to provide a better interface through a laptop
